## Technology Stack Summary

### React Native Layer
- React Native 0.82.1 with New Architecture
- TypeScript 5.8.3 (strict mode)
- Zustand (state management)
- React Navigation v6

### Security & Communication
- react-native-ble-plx (BLE)
- react-native-nfc-manager (NFC)
- react-native-biometrics
- react-native-keychain
- Platform-native cryptography (iOS Keychain/Secure Enclave, Android Keystore/TEE)

### Native Modules
- **iOS**: Swift + Objective-C bridge
- **Android**: Kotlin + JNI

### Testing
- Jest (unit tests)
- React Native Testing Library
- Platform-specific tests (XCTest, Android Instrumented Tests)

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: State Management - Zustand
**Decision**: Use Zustand instead of Redux Toolkit or MobX
**Rationale**: Lightweight, minimal boilerplate, TypeScript-friendly, sufficient for app complexity

### ADR-002: BLE Library - react-native-ble-plx
**Decision**: Use react-native-ble-plx for BLE communication
**Rationale**: Most popular (2.7k stars), actively maintained, comprehensive API, good documentation

### ADR-003: Device Identity - No User Accounts
**Decision**: Device-based identity only, no username/password accounts
**Rationale**: Simplifies onboarding, enhances privacy, aligns with hardware-backed security model

### ADR-004: Cryptography - Platform-Native Only
**Decision**: Use iOS Secure Enclave and Android Keystore exclusively, no JavaScript crypto
**Rationale**: Hardware-backed security, non-exportable keys, compliance with security requirements

Full ADRs available in `docs/adr/` (to be created during implementation).

## Security Highlights

### Core Security Principles
1. **Zero-Trust**: Private keys never leave hardware security modules
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (biometric + PIN + SE/TEE)
3. **Non-Repudiation**: Cryptographic signatures on all transactions
4. **Atomicity**: Guaranteed all-or-nothing value transfers
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history with signatures

### Transaction Limits
- Maximum offline balance: **$500.00**
- Maximum single transaction: **$100.00**
- Daily transaction limit: **$300.00** (configurable)
- Transaction velocity: Max 10 transactions/hour

### Compliance Guidance
- PCI DSS: Cardholder data handling best practices
- GDPR: Data minimization, device-local storage
- PSD2: Strong customer authentication patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Target coverage: >80% (services, stores, utilities)
- Framework: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Run: `npm test`

### Integration Testing
- Focus: Cross-service workflows (e.g., transfer flow)
- Framework: Jest
- Run: `npm run test:integration`

### Manual Testing
- Required: Physical devices for BLE/NFC
- Checklist provided in each phase
- Document results in phase MD files

### Security Testing
- Continuous: Threat modeling per phase
- Final: Comprehensive security audit (Phase 7)
- Tools: Static analysis, penetration testing

---

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- **TSDoc/JSDoc** for all public APIs
- **Inline comments** for complex logic
- **README** for each major module

### Phase Documentation
Create `docs/prd/phases/phaseN_*.md` after completing each phase with:
- Overview and achievements
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Component/service documentation
- Testing results
- Lessons learned
- Prerequisites for next phase

### Architecture Decision Records
Create `docs/adr/NNN-title.md` for significant decisions:
- Context
- Decision
- Rationale
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences

## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| SE/TEE complexity higher than estimated | 20% time buffer, early research spike |
| BLE reliability on physical devices | Early testing, maintain device matrix |
| Transaction atomicity flaws | Comprehensive testing, formal verification |
| Security audit reveals critical issues | Continuous security review throughout |

### Contingency Plans
- **Phase 4 delays**: Prioritize one platform (iOS or Android) first
- **BLE issues**: Fall back to NFC-only for demo
- **Timeline pressure**: Deliver MVP (Phases 1-4) first, add P2P later

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- ✅ Private keys never leave SE/TEE (audited)
- ✅ Transaction atomicity 100% guaranteed
- ✅ BLE and NFC functional on physical devices
